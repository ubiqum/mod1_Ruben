## General Design Feedback

I like the way you went the extra mile and looked into CSS transitions, font awesome as well as styling system components as the the scrollbars.

Good choice of sizes and not too many colors.

Also i think it is a very good solution to put the maps on individual pages. That makes the pages leaner and faster to load as well.
When we are looking into javascript we'll see how to create these pages dynamically. 

## Code issues

I added some comments in the according files.
In general i'd say, you are writing a nice and readable code.
